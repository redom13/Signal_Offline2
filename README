# Fourier Series Approximation

A Python program to approximate a given function using Fourier series expansion. The `FourierSeries` class calculates Fourier coefficients and provides a visual approximation of the function based on the given number of terms.

## Features

- Approximates functions using Fourier series.
- Supports customizable terms for Fourier expansion.
- Visualizes the approximation against the target function.

## Important Note

All the target functions must be periodic with a period of 2Ï€. For me sawtooth and triangular wave was tough to generate. So, I added an explanation of how I generated them in the code. I only provided the explanation for the triangular wave. If you understand how to generate the triangular wave, you can easily generate the sawtooth wave.
